I've started populating my <a href="http://donnemartin.com/reading-list/" target="_blank">Reading List</a>!  Updates will trickle in over the coming weeks.

I'm an avid reader, consuming 1-2 books each month in addition to tech articles, tutorials, and university course materials.

Reading helps me:

* Dream big and generate ideas for life and for work
* Increase my breadth and depth of knowledge, fueling my need to constantly learn
* Challenge and stretch my self discipline
* Expand my creativity by thinking outside of my comfort zone with new ideas, theories, and beliefs
* View the world through the brightest minds and teachers of current and previous generations
