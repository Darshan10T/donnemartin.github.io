With the final beta in the hands of testers, I thought I'd write up a review of my favorite features in Tableau 9.

## Welcome Screen

When opening up Tableau users are now welcomed with a revamped screen:

I like the flow from left (start here) to middle (do work) to right (learn more).  The new "Discover" section is a great addition for newcomers and seasoned users.

## Improved Speed

A major focus area for Tableau 9 revolves around speed.  In general Tableau 9 feels faster.  Startup, loading dashboards, and executing complex queries all seem more snappier.

## Improved Efficiency

Closely related to speed of the program is the improved efficiency users get from various workflow-streamlining features.

The [Level of Detail](http://www.tableau.com/about/blog/2015/2/introduction-level-detail-expressions-36655) and [data prep](http://interworks.co.uk/blog/data-reshaping-tableau-9-data-interpreter-data-pivot/) capabilities seem to be the focus of many articles out there right now and are sure to be a big hit.

Tooltips now update quickly as your mouse moves.  Previously I had to pause for Tableau to update the tooltip.  Sometimes I'd have to move the mouse out of a viz completely then move it back for the tooltip to update.  Another handy improvement is a tooltip shown when you hover over a tab name:

Bonus: the filmstrip mode now shows both titles and images, preventing the need to frequently swap from filmstrip mode to tab mode.

A relatively low-key though very useful addition is the Hide/Unhide All Sheets feature.  Accomplishing this in prior versions required jumping through hoops:

I appreciate that Tableau seems to be moving away from modal dialogs that block screen real estate and otherwise interrupt my workflow.  The Analytics palette, calculation editor, and pill calculations all keep my focus on the main document window rather than juggling from dialog to main window.  Speaking of keeping my eyes "focused" on where the action is, the autocomplete feature is handy as it helps prevent me from having to toggle between palettes or help docs.

## Bug Fixes and Improved Stability

Being a Mac user, one of my biggest gripes was the 'bouncing' Tableau icon on the dock whenever I kicked off a long operation and switched to another application.  This was a huge distraction and forced me to schedule operations such as data extract refreshes during my lunch break or after hours.  A later iteration of Tableau 8.x was advertised to have fixed this issue, but it was still present on my machine (MBP Retina, OSX 10.9.5).  I am happy to report this is no longer present in Tableau 9.

In addition to Story Points now being customizable, it seems they have become more robust.  I made it a habit to save prior to editing story points such as drag and dropping to change order in Tableau 8 after several lockups or 'crashes'.  I have yet to encounter these problems in the latest version.

## Conclusion

With Tableau 8 bringing great features such as 64 bit support, native OSX support, and R integration, I figured the Tableau team had their work cut out for them with the next release.  The Tableau team's focus on speed and efficiency for Tableau 9 acts as a force multiplier to it's great and rapidly growing feature set.
