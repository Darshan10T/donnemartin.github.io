I’m an engineer. I’m the kid who tirelessly built lego cities and souped up lego rides for my lego army to conquer. I've since moved on to a new sandbox built on cloud computing (Amazon Web Services), data analysis (Hadoop, Spark, Python, R, Tableau), and mobile apps (Android).

As the Cloud and Mobile Technologies Manager at Nemetschek Vectorworks, I spearhead the company’s efforts to expand its traditional CAD desktop application to include Software as a Service and mobile solutions. Hands-on and data driven, I lead the company's efforts to extract insights from our "Big Data" and to leverage predictive analytics through machine learning.

I wear many hats as the company's needs rapidly change: Software engineer, ScrumMaster, and Product Owner. I’m trilingual in geek, sales, and customer-speak.

Big ideas and plans are fruitless without proper execution. I embrace agile, lean, and operational excellence. I have big ideas. I get things done. I make my teammates look awesome.

Feel free to contact me if you want to discuss cloud, mobile, data science, or snowboarding (skiers also welcome).
