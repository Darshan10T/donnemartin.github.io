"I are an Engineer" at heart. I’m the kid who tirelessly built lego cities and souped up lego rides for my lego army to conquer. I've since moved on to a new sandbox built on cloud computing (Amazon Web Services), data analysis (Hadoop, Python, Tableau), and mobile apps (Android, Glass, Augmented Reality, iOS).

As the Cloud and Mobile Technologies Manager at Nemetschek Vectorworks, I spearhead the company’s efforts to expand its traditional CAD desktop application to include Software as a Service and mobile solutions.

I wear many hats as the company's needs rapidly change: Hands-on software engineer, ScrumMaster, and Product Owner. I’m trilingual in geek, sales, and customer-speak.

Big ideas and plans are fruitless without proper execution. I embrace agile, lean, and operational excellence. I have big ideas. I get things done. I make my teammates look awesome.

Feel free to contact me if you want to discuss cloud, mobile, data science, or snowboarding (skiers also welcome).
