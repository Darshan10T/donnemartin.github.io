## Performance vs scalability

A service is **scalable** if it results in increased **performance** in a manner proportional to resources added. Generally, increasing performance means serving more units of work, but it can also be to handle larger units of work, such as when datasets grow.<sup><a href=http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2006/03/a_word_on_scalability.html>1</a></sup>

Another way to look at performance vs scalability:

* If you have a **performance** problem, your system is slow for a single user.
* If you have a **scalability** problem, your system is fast for a single user but slow under heavy load.

## Latency vs throughput

**Latency** is the time to perform some action or to produce some result.

**Throughput** is the number of such actions or results per unit of time.

Generally, you should aim for **maximal throughput** with **acceptable latency**.

In a distributed computer system, you can only support two of the following guarantees:

* **Consistency** - Every read receives the most recent write or an error
* **Availability** - Every request receives a response, without guarantee that it contains the most recent version of the information
* **Partition Tolerance** - The system continues to operate despite arbitrary partitioning due to network failures

*Networks aren't reliable, so you'll need to support partition tolerance.  You'll need to make a software tradeoff between consistency and availability.*

#### CP - consistency and partition tolerance

Waiting for a response from the partitioned node might result in a timeout error.  CP is a good choice if your business needs require atomic reads and writes.

#### AP - availability and partition tolerance

Responses return the most recent version of the data available on the a node, which might not be the latest.  Writes might take some time to propagate when the partition is resolved.

AP is a good choice if the business needs allow for [eventual consistency](#eventual-consistency) or when the system needs to continue working despite external errors.
