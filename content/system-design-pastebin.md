**Design Bit.ly** - is a similar question, except pastebin requires storing the paste contents instead of the original unshortened url.

## Step 1: Outline use cases and constraints

> Gather requirements and scope the problem.
> Ask questions to clarify use cases and constraints.
> Discuss assumptions.

Without an interviewer to address clarifying questions, we'll define some use cases and constraints.

### Use cases

#### We'll scope the problem to handle only the following use cases

* **User** enters a block of text and gets a randomly generated link
    * Expiration
        * Default setting does not expire
        * Can optionally set a timed expiration
* **User** enters a paste's url and views the contents
* **User** is anonymous
* **Service** tracks analytics of pages
    * Monthly visit stats
* **Service** deletes expired pastes
* **Service** has high availability
