A reverse proxy is a web server that centralizes internal services and provides unified interfaces to the public.  Requests from clients are forwarded to a server that can fulfill it before the reverse proxy returns the server's response to the client.

Additional benefits include:

* **Increased security** - Hide information about backend servers, blacklist IPs, limit number of connections per client
* **Increased scalability and flexibility** - Clients only see the reverse proxy's IP, allowing you to scale servers or change their configuration
* **SSL termination** - Decrypt incoming requests and encrypt server responses so backend servers do not have to perform these potentially expensive operations
    * Removes the need to install [X.509 certificates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509) on each server
* **Compression** - Compress server responses
* **Caching** - Return the response for cached requests
* **Static content** - Serve static content directly
    * HTML/CSS/JS
    * Photos
    * Videos
    * Etc
