I had some free time over the Christmas to New Year's break and completed overhauling my personal website [donnemartin.com](http://www.donnemartin.com).  It now features a revamped look and feel along with expanded sections for:

* [Blog posts](http://donnemartin.com/blog/)
* [Projects](http://donnemartin.com/projects/)
* [Reading List](http://donnemartin.com/reading-list/)
* [About Me](http://donnemartin.com/about-me/)

## Jekyll Mirror

I've also started to build up its mirror site [donnemartin.github.io](donnemartin.github.io) to try out [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).  So far I love that I can use my existing developer tools to generate content (SublimeText, Terminal, and GitHub).

Here are other features I like about Jekyll:

* Converts Markdown to produce fast, static pages
* Simple to get started, no backend or manual updates
* Hosted on GitHub Pages
* Open source on GitHub
