* 3 Days
* 5Â keynotes
* Dozens of breakout sessions
* Countless tips, tricks, and brilliant data viz gurus

Below are personal actions I've identified to tackle for the remainder of 2014 and continue into 2015.

## Action: Start a Blog

I've found the best way for me to learn is through hands-on exploration followed by teaching.  Expressing complex technical material in an easily digestible form is challenging for anyone.  I feel blogging would allow me to further hone my communication skills and would give me a deeper understanding on topics covered.

## Action: Actively Participate in a Data Science Network

I learned as much from the people I met during the conference as the sessions and keynotes.  Actively participating in a data science network would provide a constant infusion of knowledge throughout the year.

## Action: Tie Every Analysis to an Actionable Business Decision

Unless metrics are actionable, one can argue they are merely vanity metrics.  I've sometimes reviewed (and I'll admit--even authored) an analysis that looked cool but failed to tie into an actionable business decision.  It's easy to track too many "Key Performance Indicators" and get swamped in a deluge of metrics.
