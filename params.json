{"name":"Donnemartin.GitHub.io","tagline":"","body":"\"I are an Engineer\" at heart. I’m the kid who tirelessly built lego cities and souped up lego rides for my lego army to conquer. I've since moved on to a new sandbox built on cloud computing (Amazon Web Services), data analysis (Hadoop, Python, Tableau), and mobile apps (Android, Glass, Augmented Reality, iOS).\r\n\r\nI wear many hats as requirements rapidly change: Hands-on software engineer, ScrumMaster, and Product Owner. I’m trilingual in geek, sales, and customer-speak.\r\n\r\nBig ideas and plans are fruitless without proper execution. I embrace agile, lean, and operational excellence. I have big ideas. I get things done. I make my teammates look awesome.\r\n\r\nFeel free to contact me if you want to discuss cloud, mobile, data science, or snowboarding (skiers also welcome).\r\n\r\n[View my profile on LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/donnemartin)\r\n\r\n[View my projects on GitHub](https://github.com/donnemartin)\r\n\r\n[Follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/donne_martin)\r\n\r\n[Contact me](mailto:donne.martin@gmail.com)\r\n\r\n![](https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5458997)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
